# Technologies

 * http://angularjs.org/ 
 
# Main Project Goals:

 * To have a simple angular App in order to prove the efficency and capability of SVG images manipulation.
 * Quickly.

# General behaviour: 

 * Periodically pools data from a mocked server.
 * This mocked server is mocking a satelite (That serves its data) in turn. 
 * Receives all the data in every pool and updates the SVG propertly.

*Note: Server side http://nodejs.org/ (no functionallity, but a server is needed in order to run it on Heroku)
